# Code of Conduct (Contributor Covenant v3.0 — adapted for biomedical, clinical, and health insurance contexts)

This project community is committed to a welcoming, safe, and equitable environment for everyone.

We adopt and adapt the **Contributor Covenant v3.0**: we pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all. We are committed to respecting the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio‑economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Our Standards

Positive behaviors that strengthen our community include:

- **Respect for purpose**: keep discussions and contributions aligned with the project’s goals and community spaces.
- **Kindness & honesty**: engage thoughtfully; assume good intent; seek understanding.
- **Constructive feedback**: give/receive feedback with specifics and empathy; focus on ideas, not people.
- **Accountability**: own mistakes; clarify intent; learn; repair when harm occurs.
- **Inclusivity**: welcome different viewpoints, cultural backgrounds, and communication styles.
- **Domain awareness** (biomedical/clinical/insurance): promote safe, compliant, and ethical use of data, code, and models; prefer clarity over sensational claims.

## Additional Expectations for Biomedical/Clinical/Insurance Work

Because this project often includes clinical, biomedical, and payer‑domain examples:

- **No PHI/PII** in the repository or public discussions. Use only synthetic or properly de‑identified data. Follow small‑cell suppression (e.g., do not publish counts `< 5`) and remove free text that could re‑identify individuals.
- **Data governance**: do not share access credentials, keys, or internal endpoints. Do not post any dataset, schema, or log that might expose confidential information or system internals.
- **Regulatory alignment**: do not request or share content that obviously violates institutional policies, research protocols, or applicable regulations (e.g., HIPAA‑style privacy safeguards). This Code is not legal advice; when in doubt, **do not post** and consult your privacy/compliance office.
- **Claims & marketing**: avoid unsubstantiated claims about clinical performance, safety, or insurance coverage/benefits. Provide context and references for metrics; avoid overstating generalizability.
- **No medical or coverage advice**: do not solicit or provide individualized medical advice, diagnosis, treatment guidance, or personalized insurance determinations. Direct people to licensed professionals or official resources.

## Unacceptable (Restricted) Behaviors

The following behaviors (including attempts, threats, or promotion of them) violate this Code:

- **Harassment**: violating expressed boundaries; repeated attention after a request to stop; stalking or doxxing.
- **Abuse or discrimination**: insults, slurs, stereotypes, or exclusionary behavior targeting protected or marginalized groups.
- **Sexualized behavior**: inappropriately intimate behavior in professional contexts or project spaces.
- **Breach of confidentiality**: sharing or acting on private information without permission.
- **Endangerment or threats**: violence, self‑harm encouragement, or credible threats of harm.
- **Data/privacy violations** (biomed/clinical/insurance): posting PHI/PII; uploading identifiable clinical notes; sharing proprietary payer data; exposing API keys or credentials; publishing small cells (<5) or linkable rare combinations.
- **Irresponsible content**: deceptive identity; plagiarism or failure to credit sources; non‑compliant marketing or clinical claims; spam or off‑topic promotion; unsafe or clearly harmful code examples without warnings or mitigations.

---

## Scope

This Code applies to all project spaces (GitHub issues, pull requests, code review, discussions, docs, examples) and when an individual is officially representing the project in public or external spaces.

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

**Community Moderators** (project maintainers) are responsible for clarifying standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior. They may remove or edit contributions, restrict access to spaces, and take other actions they deem appropriate.

---

## Reporting a Concern

If you experience or witness a violation, or have concerns about behavior, privacy, or security:

- **Email (maintainer):** pritika.dasgupta@gmail.com  
- You may request **confidentiality** and we will respect privacy to the extent possible while prioritizing safety.  
- If a report involves PHI/PII or security exposure, please mention “**PRIVACY/SECURITY**” in the subject so it can be triaged promptly.

(Email listed per author’s public contact details.)

Moderators will acknowledge receipt, assess the report, and respond in a timely manner. Not every conflict represents a Code violation; we will strive to resolve disagreements by reinforcing encouraged behaviors and norms.

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

We use a graduated “ladder” to match consequences and repair to the impact and severity (steps may be skipped for severe harm):

1. **Correction**  
   - *Event*: A first‑time minor violation or misunderstanding.  
   - *Consequence*: Private written reminder of expectations.  
   - *Repair*: Clarify intent; acknowledge impact; adjust behavior.

2. **Warning / Time‑limited Restrictions**  
   - *Event*: Repeated issues after a correction, or a more serious violation.  
   - *Consequence*: Formal warning; temporary limits on participation or specific channels.  
   - *Repair*: Apology to affected parties; reflection; commitment to change.

3. **Temporary Suspension**  
   - *Event*: Pattern of violations despite prior steps, or a serious incident.  
   - *Consequence*: Time‑boxed suspension from project spaces with conditions for return.  
   - *Repair*: Meet conditions, demonstrate understanding, and re‑engage constructively.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   - *Event*: Severe misconduct or continued harm with no credible path to safety.  
   - *Consequence*: Permanent removal from all project spaces.  
   - *Repair*: None applicable at this severity.

## Privacy & Security Incident Handling (Addendum)

For suspected PHI/PII or credential exposure:

- **Immediate steps**: remove content, rotate keys, invalidate tokens, and replace affected artifacts with redacted or synthetic versions.  
- **Post‑incident**: summarize what happened, the fix, and how we will prevent recurrences (to the extent feasible without re‑exposing sensitive details).
